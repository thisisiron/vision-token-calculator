    """
    Computes all allowed aspect ratios for a given minimum and maximum number of input tiles.

    This function calculates all possible arrangements of tiles that can be formed
    within the constraint of the minimum and maximum number of tiles. Each arrangement is
    represented by its aspect ratio (width/height) and the corresponding tile configuration.

    Args:
        min_image_tiles (`int`):
            The minimum number of tiles allowed.
        max_image_tiles (`int`):
            The maximum number of tiles allowed.

    Returns:
        `list[tuple[int, int]]`: A list of tuples, each tuple representing a valid (width, height)
        configuration in terms of number of tiles.
